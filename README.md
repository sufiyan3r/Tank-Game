# Tank-Game
Tank Game made using Java on Processing as part of University 1st year Programming module.

Basic Tank Game. Tank shooting enemy vehicles coming from below.

## Overview:
This file consists of my academic project at university which required me to make a defenders game on the Processing programming platform using Java. My initial plan was to create a game with a knight/warrior defending the top of the castle and killing enemy pirates climbing up the walls. 

Upon further inspiration, I decided to create a tank game which has a tank on top of the screen defending and shooting enemy vehicles coming upwards. The tank can move right, left, downwards and upward. As the bullet successfully hits the edge of the enemy vehicle the vehicle stops and points are gained which are accumulated in the scoreboard on top of the screen. The location which the enemy vehicles pop out of are random which make the game more challenging and they move upwards all independently at different/random speeds challenging the user's fast responses. As the enemy vehicles manage to reach the top of the screen and cross over if it is enough distance from the tank the game is over. 

## Future Ideas:
The game could be further improved by stopping the tank from going off-screen/boundaries and implementing levels into the game. Each level consists of different challenges (e.g., different types of vehicles, different numbers of vehicles, different speeds, etc.).
